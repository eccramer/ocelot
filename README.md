# project ocelot


make something that isn't fancy but works good  

## What do we want out of it?  

*ability to add extra workers and use them to distribute load*
Use a Queueing system (nsq? go doesn't really need a special queing system, can just set one up via channels)

*yml configuration in repository*   
*webhook triggers*  
*no special configuration on machine required, no "snowflakes"*  
*build in docker containers*  
*have endpoints on build number to allow for checking status of build*
*simple notification system*
*simple website that shows status of builds*
*endpoint for getting historical data*
*prometheus exporter for those stats (or something like that)*
