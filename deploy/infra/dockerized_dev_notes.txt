If you're reading this, you want to run the ocelot infra with the docker-compose files. This process is not completely automated, but these are the minimal manual steps:

TODO: The ocelot containers rely on docker for macOS specific dns functionality. Need to generalize this more

* Create an external network named 'ocelot'
* Start the following services: nsq (all of them), postgres, consul, vault (docker-compose -f <compose file> up -d)
* Init and unseal vault, check in consul that everyone reports healthy
* Then run the scripts/setup-cv.sh file -- Make sure your DB password is set correctly!

* Go to the project root
* Build the ocelot-builder image (make docker-base)
* Build the docker containers (make docker-build)
* Build and install the ocelot client (make local)
* Start the ocelot cluster (docker-compose up -d)

* Set your ADMIN_HOST=localhost, and ADMIN_PORT=10000 environment vars to point at your local ocelot instance

You should be up and running. To get started, you should add creds for your vcs, and anything else you need to test with.

When you start builds, you should see the docker containers started on your host docker-engine (since you mount the docker socket into all the ocelot containers)
